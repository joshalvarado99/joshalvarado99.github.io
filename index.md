# About

Hello, I am Joshua Alvarado, a 4th year Statistics and Data Science major at UCSB. I am pursuing a career in software and data. This website is an assignment for my WRIT 107T course but  This is also my first time creating a website in markdown but I am interested in using this as a template for hosting my own personal website that I can show to recruiters.

## Metal Organic Framework Absorption of Sarin: Binding site predictions

Sarin is an extremely toxic synthetic compound used as a chemical warfare agent. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline porous materials that show promise in Sarin absorption and decontaminating chemical warfare attacks. A machine learning model predicting Sarin absorption has been constructed by looking at overall absorption of individual MOFâ€™s. Created as part of the Clancy Group at Johns Hopkins University.
